#  Nearby Objects

# Quickstart
Nearby Objects is an app that allows users to find and track Close Objects (asteroids or comets) that will be flying near Earth. 

The first screen displays a list of nearby objects provided by a NASA API using default settings of how close to earth (measured in Lunar Distances) and how soon (measured in years) to monitor. 

There is a preferences page that allows a user to change the distances and timeframes they wish to monitor. 

Users can also click on the heart icon associated with a nearby object to store that object. The user can click on the countdown page to see the objects that they liked and a countdown to how soon they will be at their closest point.

### Install

There are no special instructions to build, run or access the app.
